# Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System

## Description

The Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System is designed to provide tailored healthcare recommendations based on individual patient data and medical history. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system aims to predict and suggest the most suitable healthcare interventions, medications, and lifestyle changes for each patient, enhancing their overall well-being and health outcomes.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Machine Learning:** Application of various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Development of models to forecast patient health outcomes and recommend personalized interventions.
- **Data Integration:** Integration and preprocessing of diverse healthcare data sources to create a comprehensive patient profile.
- **Healthcare Analytics:** Analysis of patient data to derive meaningful insights and recommendations.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess patient data from various sources, ensuring data quality and consistency.

- **Data Sources:** Electronic Health Records (EHRs), lab results, medical imaging, patient surveys.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, handling missing data.

### 2. Predictive Modeling

Develop predictive models to identify patterns and make recommendations based on patient data.

- **Techniques Used:** Regression, classification, clustering, ensemble methods.
- **Algorithms Used:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Means Clustering.

### 3. Recommendation System

Implement a recommendation engine to suggest personalized healthcare interventions.

- **Techniques Used:** Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches.

### 4. Evaluation and Validation

Evaluate the performance of the predictive models and recommendation system using appropriate metrics.

- **Metrics Used:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

### 5. Deployment

Deploy the recommendation system for real-time use in a healthcare setting.

- **Tools Used:** Flask, Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized_healthcare_recommendation_system.git
   cd personalized_healthcare_recommendation_system
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Preparation

1. Place raw patient data files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess data, develop predictive models, build the recommendation engine, and evaluate the system:
   - `data_preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `predictive_modeling.ipynb`
   - `recommendation_engine.ipynb`
   - `evaluation.ipynb`

### Training and Evaluation

1. Train the predictive models:
   ```bash
   python src/predictive_modeling.py --train
   ```

2. Evaluate the models:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluation.py --evaluate
   ```

### Deployment

1. Deploy the recommendation system using Flask:
   ```bash
   python src/deployment.py
   ```

## Results and Evaluation

- **Predictive Modeling:** Successfully built models that accurately predict patient health outcomes.
- **Recommendation System:** Developed a system that provides personalized healthcare recommendations with high relevance and accuracy.
- **Evaluation:** Achieved high performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) validating the effectiveness of the system.
